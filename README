===============================================================================
Created and currently maintained by:
      Yolanda Ordonez (yordonez@ub.edu)

Developed for Equip Tècnic Campus, Àrea de Tecnologies de la Universitat 
de Barcelona (Spain).
Many ideas and code were taken from other Moodle plugins and Moodle itself

Admin Report for Moodle that allows a logical deletion of courses in the platform.

UB Deleted courses is a Moodle plugin developed to allow the logical deletion of 
courses. It's fully configurable and adjustable so it can reach the needs of many 
site administrators. It can be configured so only the trusted roles could delete
(put into quarantine) courses from some or all categories. The administrators can
set how long the courses will be kept in quarantine before complete deletion and 
even if they want to keep a backup file for the deleted courses.

The software is in version 1.0; currently used in the Campus Virtual de la 
Universitat de Barcelona with satisfactory results. The languages available for 
the current version are: Catalan, Spanish and English.
